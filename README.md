# Personal Travel and Photography Website

This project showcases my travel experiences and photography portfolio through a static website hosted securely on AWS. It demonstrates my ability to work with cloud infrastructure, DevOps practices, and automation tools to deliver a fully functional, secure, and globally accessible website.

## Overview

This is a personal project where I share my photography and travel experiences. The website is hosted securely on AWS using various services like S3, CloudFront, ACM, and CloudWatch. The goal of this project is to showcase my technical skills in deploying and managing cloud infrastructure while also displaying my personal photography work.

Note: The website's assets (HTML, CSS, images) are not included in this repository for privacy and security reasons. These assets are uploaded to AWS S3 as part of the live deployment.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Cloud: AWS (S3, CloudFront, ACM, CloudWatch)
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD
- Monitoring and Alerts: AWS CloudWatch, SNS
- Domain: Managed via OVHCloud

## Architecture

- S3: The website files are stored in a private S3 bucket, only accessible through CloudFront.
- CloudFront: Serves the content globally with HTTPS enforcement via SSL/TLS (ACM). It also has    geo-restrictions set to control access.
- Terraform: Infrastructure is defined as code using Terraform, enabling easy deployment and management.
- GitLab CI/CD: Automates file transfers to S3 whenever there's a change in the repository.
- CloudWatch: Monitors the AWS resources and sends alerts for 4xx errors, bucket size, HTTP requests.

## Project Structure

- Public/ : website repository containing all the html/css and images files
- Terraform/: Contains all the Terraform files to manage AWS infrastructure devided into 2 modules 
    - main.tf: The main Terraform configuration file for the infrastructure setup.
    - variables.tf: Input variables for customization.
    - output.tf: Outputs the values for the created resources.
- .gitlab-ci.yml: GitLab CI/CD configuration for automating the deployment of the static website to AWS S3.
- README.md: This file.
- assests/: Contains all the screenshots related to this project

Note: The public/ folder, which contains the website assets (HTML, CSS, images), is excluded from this repository for security and privacy reasons.

## Setup Instructions
To deploy the infrastructure and website, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:

An AWS account with access to S3, CloudFront, ACM, and CloudWatch.
Terraform installed (version 5.0 or higher).
A GitLab account for CI/CD setup.
A domain name registered (through Route 53 or an external provider).

### Deployment Steps
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine and navigate into it:
``git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git``
``cd your-repository-name``

2. Manually Request an ACM Certificate
Request an ACM certificate in the AWS Management Console:

    1. Navigate to the Certificate Manager (ACM) service.
    2. Request a public certificate for your domain name.
    3. Approve the certificate through your domain name provider (Route 53 or an external provider).

3. Configure AWS Credentials
Ensure your AWS credentials are configured properly via the AWS CLI or environment variables in GitLab CI/CD:
``aws configure``

4. Update Variables
Modify the necessary variables.tf files in the repository to reflect your specific setup:

- Update monitoring/variables.tf to include your email address.
- Update all values in s3-cloudfront/variables.tf to match your configuration.

5. Initialize Terraform
Prepare Terraform by initializing the working directory:
``terraform init``

6. Apply the Terraform Configuration
Deploy the AWS infrastructure by applying the Terraform configuration:
``terraform apply``
This will create the necessary AWS resources, including S3, CloudFront, and monitoring configurations.

7. Update Your Domain Name Records
In your domain name provider's settings (e.g., Route 53 or an external provider), manually create a DNS record to map your custom domain name to the CloudFront domain name provided by Terraform.

8. Set Up GitLab CI/CD
Configure your GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes to the S3 bucket. Refer to the .gitlab-ci.yml file in the repository for pipeline configuration.

## Deployment

The website is deployed using the GitLab CI/CD pipeline. Whenever changes are made to the repository, the pipeline will automatically upload updated content to the S3 bucket.

1. Changes to the website (HTML/CSS) are pushed to the GitLab repository.
2. The GitLab pipeline triggers and uploads the changes to S3.
3. CloudFront serves the updated content globally.

Note: The content in the public/ folder, including images, is not part of this repository and should be uploaded to S3 separately. This can be done via GitLab CI/CD or manually.

## Monitoring
This project integrates AWS CloudWatch for resource monitoring. Key metrics like HTTP requests, 4xx errors, and S3 bucket usage are tracked. Alarms are configured to notify via SNS for important events.

1. 4xx errors: If there is an increase in client errors.
2. Bucket size: To monitor if the website's storage usage exceeds a set limit.
3. HTTP requests: To track the number of requests served by CloudFront.

## Cost Optimization
To keep the project within the AWS Free Tier limits, we have optimized resources as follows:

- CloudWatch Alarms and Metrics:
    - We utilize the 5 free alarms and select metrics available in CloudWatch.
    - Alarms are configured to trigger notifications via SNS email instead of SMS to avoid additional costs.

- Security Features:
    - We remain within the Free Tier limits by using:
        - SSL certificates from ACM.
        - Metadata management, carefully scoped IAM policies, and private S3 buckets.
        - Geo-restrictions and optimized CloudFront caching for security and performance.
    - We deliberately avoid using AWS WAF or Shield to enhance security further, as they are not included in the Free Tier.

- Free Tier Maximization:
    - All free-tier limits are utilized to their maximum extent without exceeding them, ensuring minimal costs for the project.

This approach ensures efficient cost management while maintaining a secure and functional infrastructure.
